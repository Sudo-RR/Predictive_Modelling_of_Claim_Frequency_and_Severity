# Predictive_Modelling_of_Claim_Frequency_and_Severity
This project uses the French Motor Claims insurance dataset to predict who is likely to claim and how costly those claims may be. Combining frequency and severity estimates, it calculates expected loss and premiums for policies and portfolios, showing how data enables faster, fairer pricing and clearer risk trade-offs.
